/*
* Lists the stages that are not yet supported by IBM Data Flow Designer
*
* Rationale:
* For the Upgrade scenario, it will be useful in the future to know which jobs can be 
* fully supported using Data Flow Designer. Each job that 'fails' this rule needs the 
* standard DS Client available in order to be maintained.
*
* As new stages become supported, change 'No' in the list below to 'Yes'.
